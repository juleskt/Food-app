# Recyclr

Recyclr is an app dedicated to reducing food waste. Our goal is simple: make it easy for restaurants or food producers to donate food that they would otherwise throw away to charitable organizations (NGOs, soup kitchens). Our app can allow producers to disclose to the organizations how much food they are able to donate and set up pick up locations for such food. Conversely, an organization can browse through nearby food pickup points and reserve food that they want.

## Getting Started

To build this project, you need to have Android Studio 3.0. In addition to that, the application is running on Firebase, thus requires keys to connect to the project. You can choose to setup your own Firebase Server and connect the app to it (remember to add the google_api.json to the src folder), or contact us so that we can add the keys to ours.
